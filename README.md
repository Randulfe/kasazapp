# Coding Challenge for Kasaz

React and Node.js application built for a job interview in less than one day (in kind of a hurry) which basically searches with different filters the type of flats and houses for buying in Barcelona. 

# Instruction 

## Set Up Guide

**Supported browsers:** Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Opera
**Preferred browser:** Firefox

For running the app successfully:
-	Go to `kasaz` folder in a terminal.
-	Run `npm run dev`
-	Open another terminal and go to `kasazclient`
-	Run `npm start`
The app will come with a set of predefined flats in the backend but you can also add new ones to the backend (in the “real world” would be to the database) using the post form.

For the frontend automated testing:
-	Go to the `kasazclient` folder and run npm test.

## App Features and Details
-	Frontend using React and Bootstrap
-	Backend using Nodejs and Express

### Features

**REQUIRED:**
-	Flat listing with title, price, sqm, number of rooms and number of toilets.
-	Search filters for the title and different size/price and number of rooms/toilets.

**EXTRA:**
-	Photo for the flats in the backend listing.
-	Ability to post new flats and store them in the backend.
-	Responsiveness. 
-	REST filter search (simultaneous search without the need of submitting a form)

# Outcome:
These are just some pictures demonstrating the functionality of the app.
